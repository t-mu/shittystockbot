# shittystockbot
Twitter bot posting shitty stock market advice.

### What's the deal?
Just something I came up with when I wanted to learn some basic Node.js and Git.
It's a relatively simple program and does nothing too fancy (fetch data from API, do something, post to twitter)
but still had me work on it quite a few evenings.
